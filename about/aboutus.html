    <h1>My Bio</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Stephan and I love video games. I gravitated towards video games at a very early age because I just found everything about them fascinating. I can remember
        getting my first video game when I was 4 years; it was <a id="scoobydoo">Scooby Doo: Mystery Mayhem</a> for the Game Boy Advance SP and I thought it was the best thing ever. As I grew older
        I played all sorts of games on many different consoles and some on PC. Here are a few different genres that I enjoy playing...
