                Hello, my name is Stephan and I love video games. I gravitated towards video games at a very early age
                because I just found everything about them fascinating.
                I can remember getting my first video game when I was 4 years old; it was <a id="scoobydoo">Scooby Doo:
                    Mystery Mayhem</a> for the Game Boy Advance SP and I thought
                it was the coolest thing. As I grew older I played all sorts of games on many different consoles and
                on PC. I am now currently 25 years old and have played many different generations of consoles/ video
                games.
                Some of favorites include the Game Boy Advance, Game Cube, PSP/ PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2,
                PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360. I have so many fond memories of playing with family and friends from as
                early 4 years old
                until now. You can find a few of my favorite genres and games if you navigate to the Genres page. Hope
                you enjoy!
