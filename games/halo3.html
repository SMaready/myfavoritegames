                    Halo 3 is one of the most known installments of the Halo franchise and for good reason.
                    It was one of my favorite FPS games because of the very iconic characters and story. The
                    multiplayer was fantastic and the Forge was one of the coolest features of the game in my opinion.
                    It allowed you to create your own maps which you could play on with other players.
