                    World of Warcraft is one of my favorite games of all time. This game is what got me into
                    MMOs. I can still remember playing The Burning Crusade expansion with my uncle and cousins
                    roaming this massive world that had such cool lore and lots of players to socialize with. I was
                    instantly hooked and played the following expansion when it was released. I still play on their
                    Classic servers where they give players the chance to go through the leveling process as it was in
                    2004. While I do enjoy the most recent installments of the game, there is something about those
                    first
                    three (Vanilla, The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King) that I absolutely love.
