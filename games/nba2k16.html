                    NBA 2K16 was the very first basketball game I ever played and I was instantly
                    hooked. I loved how they set it up so the character you create when launching the
                    game is the character you play as throughout various game modes. It makes for a cool story
                    that tries to immerse you and make you feel like you played a career starting as a drafted rookie
                    to a legend in the sport.
