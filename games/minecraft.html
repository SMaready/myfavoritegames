                    Minecraft is a game loved all around the world and is very famous for it's survival and
                    creative game mode. I loved both but there is something about survival where you don't have
                    unlimited resources and you have to strategically plan how you want use your resources to survive
                    that makes me wanting to come back to play all the time.
