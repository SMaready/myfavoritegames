                    FIFA 15 is my favorite sports game of all time. It was at a point where the game
                    was not yet as realistic as it is now but that's what made it fun. Being able to
                    perform ridiculous plays with players who you really shouldn't have been able to
                    run these plays with. I can still remember being in high school playing with all my
                    friends at the time because FIFA has a game mode where you can play on a team online
                    but only as your created character in your assigned position. This game will always be
                    the best installment of the franchise just because I have so many fond memories playing it.
