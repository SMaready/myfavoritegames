                    Super Mario Strikers is a Mario soccer game! This game is just a very goofy but super
                    fun game to play with friends. It has the iconic characters that we all know and love and
                    you get to create a team with these characters. Not only do you get to play as these characters
                    but you can play these soccer matches in arenas with themes of famous zones/maps in the franchise
                    such
                    as Luigi's Mansion.
