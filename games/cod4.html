                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is one of those games that I look back on and think about all the great
                    memories I had playing with family and friends. It was my first time
                    playing a FPS multiplayer game and I was immediately hooked. I loved being able to play a
                    competitive shooter with other players.
