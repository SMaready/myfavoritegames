                    Elder Scrolls Online is one of my favorite games. Who doesn't love Elder Scrolls?
                    Skyrim was one of the greatest games of all time in my opinion and when I heard
                    there was going to be an MMO set in that world I knew I would love it. I still remember
                    playing after school with a bunch of my buddies trying to get through difficult dungeons.
