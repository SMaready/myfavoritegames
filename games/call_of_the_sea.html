                    Call of the Sea is a game I randomly came across when navigating through the Xbox Game Pass and was
                    intrigued by the description and trailer. It follows a woman who is looking for her husband on a
                    mysterious
                    island after he has gone missing on an expedition in search for a cure for his wife's disease. It
                    has so many amazing puzzles, great visuals, and it really does a great job at immersing you in this
                    world.
