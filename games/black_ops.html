                    Black Ops was the first FPS game I played that was set in the past and tied into real events that
                    took place.
                    It was set in the 1960's during the Cold War and followed really cool protagonists that you played
                    as in their
                    campaign game mode. It also had a great multiplayer game mode with cool new features such as the
                    dolphin dive and
                    was one of the most played FPS games of all time. I am a big fan of map design especially when it
                    comes to these
                    fast paced shooter games and Treyarch maps traditionally have a great flow because of their three
                    lane map design.
                    The game was released in 2010 by Treyarch.
