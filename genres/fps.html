        One of the most known and beloved genres in the video game community is FPS. FPS games have been part of the gaming industry since the 1970's with games like <em>Maze  
        War</em> but did not become very popular until the 1990's when games like <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em> were released. My introduction to first person shooteres was
        Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. I then got into other series such as Halo with the release of Halo 3.
